- **Pitcher rules:** Never use a pitcher against your own hitters. Prioritize pitchers with high K% and ceiling, not just win odds. Ownership leverage: max 1 chalk pitcher ≥40% owned unless paired with a contrarian stack.
- **Ownership leverage:** Max 4 hitters ≥20% owned. Require ≥2 hitters ≤10% (≥1 ≤5%). Cap total lineup ownership ≤135%.
- **Ceiling emphasis:** Target power bats (HR/ISO, fly ball rates), SB upside, and hitters at premium lineup spots (1–5). Deprioritize low-ceiling punts unless they unlock contrarian stacks.
- **Game environments:** Stack games with high implied totals and hitter-friendly parks. Consider weather (wind, temp) when boosting ceilings.
